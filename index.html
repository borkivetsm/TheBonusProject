           <h2>Bonus™ lets you sell your home AND continue building equity.</h2>
           <p>When selling your home to Bonus™, not only do you get money for your home today, but we let you share in your home's future value by keeping a percentage of ownership to sell again in the future — it's like profiting twice.</p>

           <p>Selling your home doesn't have to mean giving up its future worth. Bonus™ lets you sell your current equity, move out and still keep ownership in your home. With no showings, no closing costs and lower fees than a traditional sale, Bonus™ is a faster, easier and smarter way to sell, all while keeping your home as a long-term investment!</p>
